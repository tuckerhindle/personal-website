	abstract = {Florida’s beaches are highly dynamic coastalfeatures. They are vulnerable to accretion and erosionover time due in part to human interaction and climatechange stressors such as storm activity. This study usedthe USGS Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) tocalculate a long-term change rate from 1875 to 2000 anda short-term change rate from 1950 to 2000 of Florida’scoastline from the NOAA Historical Surveys data set.The results show that Florida’s coastline has not retreatedin the past 50 years with overall long and short-termchange rates of 0.014 m/yr and 0.110 m/yr of accretionrespectively. Although the overall rates imply minimalchange, coastline variability at a local level is prevalent.The data set of mapped historical change rates createdduring this research provides quantitative data that can beused to make local decisions to improve beach stability.},
