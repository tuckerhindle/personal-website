        * Managed, analyzed, and modeled geospatial and hydrologic data using ArcGIS Pro.
        * Implemented ML techniques to model groundwater elevations using regression analysis and map impervious surfaces using multispectral image classification.
        * Developed a GIS-based flood risk screening tool capable of generating accurate probabilistic inundation maps quickly while still detecting localized nuisance-destructive flood potential.
        * Integrated the SFWMD CASCADE 2001 flood routing model and Arc Hydro with GIS to compare the predicted flood response to heavy rains at varying scales of analysis.
        * Prepared maps and technical reports to support the development of watershed-based flood protection plans across Florida ([CWR3](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/research/cwr3/)).
        * Designed a flood management plan in compliance with the NFIP Community Rating System to assist the City of Clewiston, Florida with advanced modeling tools for assessing stormwater risk and solutions.
