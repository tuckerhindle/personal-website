Currently, I am an instructor for the _Multidisciplinary Research Methods_ course series and focus on mentoring undergraduate research at [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu) (FAU). My research interests are geospatial data science and remote sensing image analysis.

I gained industry experience as a GIS Analyst at [AECOM](https://aecom.com) in the Data Science & Analytics Group using ArcGIS Pro, Python and R programming on projects in transportation, water resources, environmental management, energy and communications infrastructure.

I was fortunate to be advised by [Fred Bloetscher, PhD, PE](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frederick-Bloetscher) and [Hongbo Su, PhD, PSM](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/directory/faculty/su-h) while working as a GIS researcher in the [Center for Water Resiliency and Risk Reduction](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/research/cwr3/about) and [Laboratory for Remote Sensing and Hydrometeorology](http://faculty.eng.fau.edu/suh) at FAU. My thesis research focused on downscaling a GIS-based flood risk screening tool to support development of watershed-based flood protection plans across Florida.
