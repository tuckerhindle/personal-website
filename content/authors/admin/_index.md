My expertise is in geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing with a focus on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based data acquisition and image analysis. Currently, I mentor FAU High School students engaged in undergraduate research at Florida Atlantic University and conduct my own research in watershed hydrology and airborne VNIR imaging spectroscopy. Prior to coming to academia, I gained industry experience in geospatial data science and analytics at AECOM while supporting projects for NASA, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, Florida DOT, and local municipalities. My application of geospatial technologies focuses on transportation, water resources, environmental management, energy and communications infrastructure.
